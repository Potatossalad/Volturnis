Slurry mix:
    Just a mix of every status
    liquid
Slurry Mixer:
    Mixes things into slurry mix
    molten surge + blast compound + pyratite + cryocrystal
    thisll be an item
        chuck it into an industrial liquifaction machine and itll make a liquid slurry thatll be as strong as molten piss. thisll also debuff molten piss, put idk by how much.
Cryocrystal:
    used for turrets
    used in slurry mixer
Cryofluid
    Probs a requirement for surge forge and fusion reactor, bc i need to debuff them
Cooler:
    Cools cryofluid into crystals
Volturnis:
    Yes I know its a one letter change from an audiomachine album. Bite Me. I like them <3
    Old race of entities. Maybe biological.
    Might make a planet called voltaria
    Going to have its own tech tree
