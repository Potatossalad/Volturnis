Slurry mix:
    Just a mix of every status
    liquid
Slurry Mixer:
    Mixes things into slurry mix
    molten surge + blast compound + pyratite + cryocrystal
    thisll be an item
        chuck it into an industrial liquifaction machine and itll make a liquid slurry thatll be as strong as molten piss. thisll also debuff molten piss, put idk by how much.
Cryocrystal:
    used for turrets
    used in slurry mixer
Cryofluid
    Probs a requirement for surge forge and fusion reactor, bc i need to debuff them
Cooler:
    Cools cryofluid into crystals
Volturnis:
    Old race of entities. Maybe biological.
    Might make a planet called Voltaria
    Going to have its own tech tree
    Made the Precursors
Uranium Fuel production:
    Production of yellowcake:
        Mining Uranium
        Milling Uranium 
        Water added to make a slurry
        Slurry is leached with sulfuric acid which dissolves the uranium leaving the other minerals solid (tailings). Dissolved Uranium is called Pregnant Solution.
        Solvent is used to extract Uranium Ions
        Pregnant Solution is then stripped using nitrates
        Uranium is precipitated out using hydrogen peroxide
        Precipitate is filtered then dried then heated to make yellowcake
    Yellowcake -> Uranium Hexafluoride:
        Yellowcake is reacted with hydrogen at high temps to make Uranium Dioxide
        UO2 is reacted with Hydrofluoric Acid in a fluidized bed reactor to produce Uranium Tetrafluoride
        UF4 is then reacted with gaseous F2 to produce Uranium Hexafluoride
    Enrichment:
        UF6 is put into Gas Centrifuges to seperate based on mass difference
            Produces depleted uranium (DU) as a byproduct. DU can be used for ammo, or reprocessed for more U235.
    Resolidification:
        Combine with Calcium Oxide
            Produces Calcium Fluoride (CaF2) (solid) and Uranium Dioxide (solid)
        UO2 is heated to 1400C
        Extruded into pellets
        Loaded into Zirconium Fuel Rods
