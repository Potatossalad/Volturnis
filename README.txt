These things are just qol things for me. May try making it more advanced in the future.
Sprites:
Surge Forge is a handmade upscaled Surge Smelter.
Surge Melter was a recolored Melter.
Scrapper was a recolored Pulveriser
I actually sprited the Fusion Reactor myself! (even though it is still kinda bad).
Sharded Cooler is a cryfluid with its blue switched over to the cryofluid blue, and its arrows are reversed.
I don't plan on making sprites for the silicon constitutor yet (no ideas).
The liquid thrower is probably not going to have a sprite at all (its literally the most op turret).
