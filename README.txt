These things are just qol things for me. May try making it more advanced in the future.
Sprites:
Induced Kiln was borrowed from ExoGenesis. It's a really fun mod, you should check it out!
Surge Forge is a handmade upscaled Surge Smelter.
Surge Melter was a recolored Melter.
Scrapper was a recolored Pulveriser
I actually sprited the Fusion Reactor myself! (even though it is still kinda bad).
